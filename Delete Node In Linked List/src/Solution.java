/**
 * Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
 *
 * Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
 * Output: [4,1,9]
 * Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling
 * your function.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
 * Output: [4,5,9]
 * Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling
 * your function.
 *
 *  * Definition for singly-linked list.
 *  * public class ListNode {
 *  *     int val;
 *  *     ListNode next;
 *  *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 *  * }
